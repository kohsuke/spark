I"«?<p>The <code>spark-submit</code> script in Spark&#8217;s <code>bin</code> directory is used to launch applications on a cluster.
It can use all of Spark&#8217;s supported <a href="cluster-overview.html#cluster-manager-types">cluster managers</a>
through a uniform interface so you don&#8217;t have to configure your application especially for each one.</p>

<h1 id="bundling-your-applications-dependencies">Bundling Your Application&#8217;s Dependencies</h1>
<p>If your code depends on other projects, you will need to package them alongside
your application in order to distribute the code to a Spark cluster. To do this,
create an assembly jar (or &#8220;uber&#8221; jar) containing your code and its dependencies. Both
<a href="https://github.com/sbt/sbt-assembly">sbt</a> and
<a href="http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-shade-plugin/">Maven</a>
have assembly plugins. When creating assembly jars, list Spark and Hadoop
as <code>provided</code> dependencies; these need not be bundled since they are provided by
the cluster manager at runtime. Once you have an assembled jar you can call the <code>bin/spark-submit</code>
script as shown here while passing your jar.</p>

<p>For Python, you can use the <code>--py-files</code> argument of <code>spark-submit</code> to add <code>.py</code>, <code>.zip</code> or <code>.egg</code>
files to be distributed with your application. If you depend on multiple Python files we recommend
packaging them into a <code>.zip</code> or <code>.egg</code>.</p>

<h1 id="launching-applications-with-spark-submit">Launching Applications with spark-submit</h1>

<p>Once a user application is bundled, it can be launched using the <code>bin/spark-submit</code> script.
This script takes care of setting up the classpath with Spark and its
dependencies, and can support different cluster managers and deploy modes that Spark supports:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">./bin/spark-submit <span class="se">\</span>
  <span class="nt">--class</span> &lt;main-class&gt; <span class="se">\</span>
  <span class="nt">--master</span> &lt;master-url&gt; <span class="se">\</span>

  <span class="nt">--conf</span> &lt;key&gt;<span class="o">=</span>&lt;value&gt; <span class="se">\</span>
  ... <span class="c"># other options</span>
  &lt;application-jar&gt; <span class="se">\</span>
  <span class="o">[</span>application-arguments]</code></pre></figure>

<p>Some of the commonly used options are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>--class</code>: The entry point for your application (e.g. <code>org.apache.spark.examples.SparkPi</code>)</li>
  <li><code>--master</code>: The <a href="#master-urls">master URL</a> for the cluster (e.g. <code>spark://23.195.26.187:7077</code>)</li>
  <li><code>--deploy-mode</code>: Whether to deploy your driver on the worker nodes (<code>cluster</code>) or locally as an external client (<code>client</code>) (default: <code>client</code>) <b> &#8224; </b></li>
  <li><code>--conf</code>: Arbitrary Spark configuration property in key=value format. For values that contain spaces wrap &#8220;key=value&#8221; in quotes (as shown). Multiple configurations should be passed as separate arguments. (e.g. <code>--conf &lt;key&gt;=&lt;value&gt; --conf &lt;key2&gt;=&lt;value2&gt;</code>)</li>
  <li><code>application-jar</code>: Path to a bundled jar including your application and all dependencies. The URL must be globally visible inside of your cluster, for instance, an <code>hdfs://</code> path or a <code>file://</code> path that is present on all nodes.</li>
  <li><code>application-arguments</code>: Arguments passed to the main method of your main class, if any</li>
</ul>

<p><b>&#8224;</b> A common deployment strategy is to submit your application from a gateway machine
that is
physically co-located with your worker machines (e.g. Master node in a standalone EC2 cluster).
In this setup, <code>client</code> mode is appropriate. In <code>client</code> mode, the driver is launched directly
within the <code>spark-submit</code> process which acts as a <em>client</em> to the cluster. The input and
output of the application is attached to the console. Thus, this mode is especially suitable
for applications that involve the REPL (e.g. Spark shell).</p>

<p>Alternatively, if your application is submitted from a machine far from the worker machines (e.g.
locally on your laptop), it is common to use <code>cluster</code> mode to minimize network latency between
the drivers and the executors. Currently, the standalone mode does not support cluster mode for Python
applications.</p>

<p>For Python applications, simply pass a <code>.py</code> file in the place of <code>&lt;application-jar&gt;</code> instead of a JAR,
and add Python <code>.zip</code>, <code>.egg</code> or <code>.py</code> files to the search path with <code>--py-files</code>.</p>

<p>There are a few options available that are specific to the
<a href="cluster-overview.html#cluster-manager-types">cluster manager</a> that is being used.
For example, with a <a href="spark-standalone.html">Spark standalone cluster</a> with <code>cluster</code> deploy mode,
you can also specify <code>--supervise</code> to make sure that the driver is automatically restarted if it
fails with a non-zero exit code. To enumerate all such options available to <code>spark-submit</code>,
run it with <code>--help</code>. Here are a few examples of common options:</p>

<h1 id="loading-configuration-from-a-file">Loading Configuration from a File</h1>

<p>The <code>spark-submit</code> script can load default <a href="configuration.html">Spark configuration values</a> from a
properties file and pass them on to your application. By default, it will read options
from <code>conf/spark-defaults.conf</code> in the Spark directory. For more detail, see the section on
<a href="configuration.html#loading-default-configurations">loading default configurations</a>.</p>

<p>Loading default Spark configurations this way can obviate the need for certain flags to
<code>spark-submit</code>. For instance, if the <code>spark.master</code> property is set, you can safely omit the
<code>--master</code> flag from <code>spark-submit</code>. In general, configuration values explicitly set on a
<code>SparkConf</code> take the highest precedence, then flags passed to <code>spark-submit</code>, then values in the
defaults file.</p>

<p>If you are ever unclear where configuration options are coming from, you can print out fine-grained
debugging information by running <code>spark-submit</code> with the <code>--verbose</code> option.</p>

<h1 id="advanced-dependency-management">Advanced Dependency Management</h1>
<p>When using <code>spark-submit</code>, the application jar along with any jars included with the <code>--jars</code> option
will be automatically transferred to the cluster. URLs supplied after <code>--jars</code> must be separated by commas. That list is included in the driver and executor classpaths. Directory expansion does not work with <code>--jars</code>.</p>

<p>Spark uses the following URL scheme to allow different strategies for disseminating jars:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>file:</strong> - Absolute paths and <code>file:/</code> URIs are served by the driver&#8217;s HTTP file server, and
every executor pulls the file from the driver HTTP server.</li>
  <li><strong>hdfs:</strong>, <strong>http:</strong>, <strong>https:</strong>, <strong>ftp:</strong> - these pull down files and JARs from the URI as expected</li>
  <li><strong>local:</strong> - a URI starting with local:/ is expected to exist as a local file on each worker node.  This
means that no network IO will be incurred, and works well for large files/JARs that are pushed to each worker,
or shared via NFS, GlusterFS, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that JARs and files are copied to the working directory for each SparkContext on the executor nodes.
This can use up a significant amount of space over time and will need to be cleaned up. With YARN, cleanup
is handled automatically, and with Spark standalone, automatic cleanup can be configured with the
<code>spark.worker.cleanup.appDataTtl</code> property.</p>

<p>Users may also include any other dependencies by supplying a comma-delimited list of Maven coordinates
with <code>--packages</code>. All transitive dependencies will be handled when using this command. Additional
repositories (or resolvers in SBT) can be added in a comma-delimited fashion with the flag <code>--repositories</code>.
(Note that credentials for password-protected repositories can be supplied in some cases in the repository URI,
such as in <code>https://user:password@host/...</code>. Be careful when supplying credentials this way.)
These commands can be used with <code>pyspark</code>, <code>spark-shell</code>, and <code>spark-submit</code> to include Spark Packages.</p>

<p>For Python, the equivalent <code>--py-files</code> option can be used to distribute <code>.egg</code>, <code>.zip</code> and <code>.py</code> libraries
to executors.</p>
