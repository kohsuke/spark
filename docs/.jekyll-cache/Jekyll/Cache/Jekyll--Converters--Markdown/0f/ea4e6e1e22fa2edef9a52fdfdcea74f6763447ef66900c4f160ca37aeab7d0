I"CR<p>Spark Streaming can receive streaming data from any arbitrary data source beyond
the ones for which it has built-in support (that is, beyond Kafka, Kinesis, files, sockets, etc.).
This requires the developer to implement a <em>receiver</em> that is customized for receiving data from
the concerned data source. This guide walks through the process of implementing a custom receiver
and using it in a Spark Streaming application. Note that custom receivers can be implemented
in Scala or Java.</p>

<h2 id="implementing-a-custom-receiver">Implementing a Custom Receiver</h2>

<p>This starts with implementing a <strong>Receiver</strong>
(<a href="api/scala/index.html#org.apache.spark.streaming.receiver.Receiver">Scala doc</a>,
<a href="api/java/org/apache/spark/streaming/receiver/Receiver.html">Java doc</a>).
A custom receiver must extend this abstract class by implementing two methods</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>onStart()</code>: Things to do to start receiving data.</li>
  <li><code>onStop()</code>: Things to do to stop receiving data.</li>
</ul>

<p>Both <code>onStart()</code> and <code>onStop()</code> must not block indefinitely. Typically, <code>onStart()</code> would start the threads
that are responsible for receiving the data, and <code>onStop()</code> would ensure that these threads receiving the data
are stopped. The receiving threads can also use <code>isStopped()</code>, a <code>Receiver</code> method, to check whether they
should stop receiving data.</p>

<p>Once the data is received, that data can be stored inside Spark
by calling <code>store(data)</code>, which is a method provided by the Receiver class.
There are a number of flavors of <code>store()</code> which allow one to store the received data
record-at-a-time or as whole collection of objects / serialized bytes. Note that the flavor of
<code>store()</code> used to implement a receiver affects its reliability and fault-tolerance semantics.
This is discussed <a href="#receiver-reliability">later</a> in more detail.</p>

<p>Any exception in the receiving threads should be caught and handled properly to avoid silent
failures of the receiver. <code>restart(&lt;exception&gt;)</code> will restart the receiver by
asynchronously calling <code>onStop()</code> and then calling <code>onStart()</code> after a delay.
<code>stop(&lt;exception&gt;)</code> will call <code>onStop()</code> and terminate the receiver. Also, <code>reportError(&lt;error&gt;)</code>
reports an error message to the driver (visible in the logs and UI) without stopping / restarting
the receiver.</p>

<p>The following is a custom receiver that receives a stream of text over a socket. It treats
&#8216;\n&#8217; delimited lines in the text stream as records and stores them with Spark. If the receiving thread
has any error connecting or receiving, the receiver is restarted to make another attempt to connect.</p>

<p>The custom receiver can be used in a Spark Streaming application by using
<code>streamingContext.receiverStream(&lt;instance of custom receiver&gt;)</code>. This will create

<h2 id="receiver-reliability">Receiver Reliability</h2>
<p>As discussed in brief in the
<a href="streaming-programming-guide.html#receiver-reliability">Spark Streaming Programming Guide</a>,
there are two kinds of receivers based on their reliability and fault-tolerance semantics.</p>

<ol>
  <li><em>Reliable Receiver</em> - For <em>reliable sources</em> that allow sent data to be acknowledged, a
  <em>reliable receiver</em> correctly acknowledges to the source that the data has been received
  and stored in Spark reliably (that is, replicated successfully). Usually,
  implementing this receiver involves careful consideration of the semantics of source
  acknowledgements.</li>
  <li><em>Unreliable Receiver</em> - An <em>unreliable receiver</em> does <em>not</em> send acknowledgement to a source. This can be used for sources that do not support acknowledgement, or even for reliable sources when one does not want or need to go into the complexity of acknowledgement.</li>
</ol>

<p>To implement a <em>reliable receiver</em>, you have to use <code>store(multiple-records)</code> to store data.
This flavor of <code>store</code> is a blocking call which returns only after all the given records have
been stored inside Spark. If the receiver&#8217;s configured storage level uses replication
(enabled by default), then this call returns after replication has completed.
Thus it ensures that the data is reliably stored, and the receiver can now acknowledge the
source appropriately. This ensures that no data is lost when the receiver fails in the middle
of replicating data &#8211; the buffered data will not be acknowledged and hence will be later resent
by the source.</p>

<p>An <em>unreliable receiver</em> does not have to implement any of this logic. It can simply receive
records from the source and insert them one-at-a-time using <code>store(single-record)</code>. While it does
not get the reliability guarantees of <code>store(multiple-records)</code>, it has the following advantages:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The system takes care of chunking that data into appropriate sized blocks (look for block
interval in the <a href="streaming-programming-guide.html">Spark Streaming Programming Guide</a>).</li>
  <li>The system takes care of controlling the receiving rates if the rate limits have been specified.</li>
  <li>Because of these two, unreliable receivers are simpler to implement than reliable receivers.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following table summarizes the characteristics of both types of receivers</p>

<table class="table">
<tr>
  <th>Receiver Type</th>
