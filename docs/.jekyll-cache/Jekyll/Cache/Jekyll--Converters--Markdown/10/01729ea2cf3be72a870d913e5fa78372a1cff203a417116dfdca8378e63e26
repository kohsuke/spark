I"c<p>Operations performed on numeric types (with the exception of decimal) are not checked for overflow. This means that in case an operation causes an overflow, the result is the same that the same operation returns in a Java/Scala program (eg. if the sum of 2 integers is higher than the maximum value representable, the result is a negative number).</p>
