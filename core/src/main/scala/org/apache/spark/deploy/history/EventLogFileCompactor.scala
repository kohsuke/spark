/**
 * This class compacts the old event log files into one compact file, via two phases reading:
 *
 * 1) Initialize available [[EventFilterBuilder]] instances, and replay the old event log files with
 * builders, so that these builders can gather the information to create [[EventFilter]] instances.
 * 2) Initialize [[EventFilter]] instances from [[EventFilterBuilder]] instances, and replay the
 * old event log files with filters. Rewrite the events to the compact file which the filters decide
 * to accept.
 *
 * This class will calculate the score based on statistic from [[EventFilter]] instances, which
 * represents approximate rate of filtered-out events. Score is being calculated via applying
 * heuristic; task events tend to take most size in event log.
 *
 * This class assumes caller will provide the sorted list of files which are sorted by the index of
 * event log file, with "at most" one compact file placed first if it exists. Caller should keep in
 * mind that this class doesn't care about the semantic of ordering.
 *
 * When compacting the files, the range of compaction for given file list is determined as:
 * (first ~ the file where there're `maxFilesToRetain` files on the right side)
 *
 * If there're not enough files on the range of compaction, compaction will be skipped.
