/**
 * The base interface for v2 data sources which don't have a real catalog. Implementations must
 * have a public, 0-arg constructor.
 * <p>
 * Note that, TableProvider can only apply data operations to existing tables, like read, append,
 * delete, and overwrite. It does not support the operations that require metadata changes, like
 * create/drop tables.
 * <p>
 * The major responsibility of this interface is to return a {@link Table} for read/write.
